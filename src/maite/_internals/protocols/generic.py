# Note
# (1) the use of each generic variable can differ in generic components
# (2) the use of a generic affects the statically-correct way to declare that generic's type variance
# Because of (1) and (2), I can't use the same TypeVars in all places where an input/target/metadata object
# is expected. This sacrifices some clarity in this file, but hopefully the classes can appear intuitive
# from the perspective of the end-users that only interact with parameterized generics.

# (3) Methods/signatures advertised by a protocol class *must* be mirrored by
# compatible types in implementation. If overload decorator is present,
# only the 'overload'-decorated methods are the source of these "promised" signatures
# for the type checker. If more than one signature is advertised by a protocol,
# then implementers must use 'overload'-decorator to advertise compatible signatures.

# In light of these rules, what should we do?
#   - Including overload in protocol signatures is clear, but does require
#     protocol implementers to leverage 'overload' decorator, which isn't quite 'beginner' level
#   - Not including overload in protocol signatures makes it possible to implement
#     protocols without helping type checker determine specific return types.
#     this is more flexible for implementer, but will require more type narrowing
#     on non-specific ("union") return types. (If typechecker can't determine return
#     type from Model('BatchInputType') is a 'BatchTargetType' and not an TargetType,
#     user has to type narrow.
#   - Seems like overload decorator is the cost of handling multiple types of input arguments

# TODO: Consider whether using Datum as a TypeAlias is more confusing than helpful
#         It seems we just need 3 typevars in the TypeAlias assignment and the TypeVar
#         type variance is completely inconsequential (because they are substituted for
#         when the TypeAlias is used (as 'Any' or as the provided bracketed types.) We
#         could also define a 4th version of Input/Target/Metadata types, but this also
#         seems confusing.
# TODO: Consider how easily and usefully variadic generics (which sound a bit scary)
#         could be used to helpfully represent the shape of an expected array.
#         So, for example, instead of having type hints that specified that 'InputType=ArrayLike'
#         we could say 'InputType=ArrayLike[H,W,C]'. -- This would require python > 3.11, which is
#         not an option in short to mid term.
