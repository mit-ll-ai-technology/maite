=========================================
Welcome to MAITE's documentation!
=========================================

The Modular AI Trustworthy Engineering (MAITE) library provides common interfaces, 
utilities, and tooling to streamline the development of test and evaluation (T&E) capabilities, 
support core evaluation use cases, and allow composition of T&E tools into custom workflows.

Installation
============

The core of MAITE is lightweight: its only dependencies is ``typing-extensions``. 
To install it, run:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install maite

If instead you want to try out the features in the upcoming version, you can install 
the latest pre-release of MAITE with:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install --pre maite

The MAITE library also contains APIs and helper utilities to provide interoperability with
various other open-source libraries such as
`HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/datasets>`_,
`TorchVision <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html>`_, and
`TorchMetrics <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/torchmetrics>`_.
To leverage these capabilities, run the following command to install maite
along with these other dependencies:

.. code:: console

   $ pip install maite[all_interop]
